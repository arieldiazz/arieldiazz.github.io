<H3> When will the Yankees return to the World Series? </H3>
<P style="font-size:18px"> While the yankees have won 27 world series titles, it has been 7 years since their last title & 4 years since their last post season win. Most people have taken it	
that the yankees dynasty is officially over & claim they don't know when it'll be back, but the true yankees fans know that General Manager, Brian Cashman, has been making
careful trades in order to build up the yankees farm system. The trading of pitchers Andrew Miller and Aroldis Chapman after the all star break in 2016 ended up boosting the yankee farm 
system into the top 10. Some of the best prospects were called up towards the end of the 2016 season & they quickly made a name fo themselves</P>
<P style="font-size:18px"> These popular prospects included first basemen,Tyler Austin, outfielder,Aaron Judge, & Catcher, Gary Sanchez. Austin & Judge made their presence very well known when they hit back
to back homeruns in their major league debut. Sanchez also became well known when he hit 20 homeruns in just 53 games. This also put him in the running for the 2016 Rookie of the Year
award. These player soon became the favorites of many yankee fans & earned the title of the "Baby Bombers." 
<P style="font-size:18px"> In addition to the baby bombers, the yankeees still have incredible depth in their minor league teams with players like Clint Frazier & James Kaprielian. These 
prospects will be ready for the majors in the coming years and will help bring a title back to the bronx. While the prospects are huge part of the yankees rebuild, another important aspect
is that the big name contracts like Alex Rodiguez & Mark Teixeira & CC Sabathia will all be gone hence freeing up money for future free agents such as Bryce Harper & Manny Machado. If everything
goes the yankees way, Yankee fans are hopeful for a 2019 (or hopefully sooner) world series win. Yankees Universe will continue to hope for the best and put their trust in GM Brian Cashman 
and put their faith in the prospects so that we can soon #StartSpreadingTheNews about a yankees world series! </p>
